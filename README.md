## How to print
You can easily 3D print parts in mechanics folder with most of 3D printers.<br>
Best results are obtained using an Original Prusa i3 MK3.<br>
Check this [wiki page](https://github.com/gbr1/erwhi-hedgehog-mechanics/wiki/How-to-print-ERWHI-using-an-Original-Prusa-i3-MK3) about how to 3D print parts with Original Prusa i3 MK3.
<br>
Check tolerance for magnet motor bracket, if your print is good it can be mounted without glue.
